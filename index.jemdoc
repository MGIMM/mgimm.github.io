== About me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [https://www.lpsm.paris/ LPSM], working with [http://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/biau/ Gérard Biau] and [https://clinicalepidemio.fr/members-of-the-team/raphael-porcher/ Raphaël Porcher]. We are interested in building statistically sound strategy in the Heterogeneous Treatment Effects context.\n
Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from [http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/ Sorbonne Université] in June 2020,
under the supervision of [http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/guyader/
Arnaud Guyader] and 
[http://cermics.enpc.fr/~lelievre/ Tony Lelièvre]. We mainly investigated the general framework of Sequential Monte Carlo method. The primary motivating application is the Rare-event Simulation in Molecular Dynamics. \[[./doc/main.pdf Manuscript]\] \[[./doc/slides.pdf Slides]\]  

== Research Interests
- Nonparametric statistics 
- Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
- Sequential Monte Carlo 
- Genealogy in Interacting Particle System
